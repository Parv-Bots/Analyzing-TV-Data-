# Analyzing TV Data

Utilizing data manipulation and visualization to conduct 
exploratory analysis on two TV datasets for:

1) Super Bowl
2) The Office

For Super Bowl we look at game outcomes, viewership, and halftime shows.
While, for The Office we develop a plot to visualize the 
viewership quality of first 9 seasons of The Office
